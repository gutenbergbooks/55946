inculcates our future generations with prejudice
against the original mother country, and the anti-British
are crying for more, let’s fit-in with something

glorious jazz age. Therefore, we offer for your

<p class="dropcap">Things started off wrong in the beginning when
Adam had to give up one of his ribs for Eve, but
in spite of this, he, like a game sport, tipped his
fig leaf to her upon their first introduction. All ran
smoothly until Eve raised Cain, and thus our ancestors
(after the monkeys) kept up a constant increase until
Noah got inside dope about the flood, whereupon he
built the Ark.</p>

<p>Our troubles might have been relegated to the
word finis, but Noah stuck up a good old boat and saved
his wife, his animals, and their wives. Then Nero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
played havoc with Rome and made the fiddle famous
as the city burned. We’ve been fiddling ever since.</p>

<p>Job next started showing his rights with the off
shoots of the chosen people and they said they would
stone him to death if he didn’t stop. He came right
back by saying, “If you do I’ll turn my bears loose and
they will eat you.” The people did, Job did and the
bears did. Then Job was King.</p>

<p>I’d like to take some of your time and present the
argument between Anthony and Cleopatra, but there
was so little between them that it is hardly worth while.</p>

<p>In the days when Cleopatra and Anthony were
such good friends, Anthony had just won a big battle
and he sent his runners to Cleopatra to tell her to doll
up in her glad rags and they would go out stepping.
On the way to her flat he met his runners returning.
They announced, “Oh, Kind Sir: Cleopatra is down
with Tonsilitis.”</p>

<p>“Darn those Greeks,” said Anthony, “I shall declare
war on Athens tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Henry Ford started one thing that he played
wrong (his cars play good tunes though), when he
decided to end the World’s War by taking a lot of men
and old maids to France and Germany. If he’d taken
some of Ziegfield’s chorus girls the war would have
been over and President Wilson would still have been
a great man. Just march those girls up No Man’s land,
and there would have been so many soldiers following
them that a Burroughs adding machine couldn’t count
them in the time it takes light to travel from the Sun
to Jupiter. Army recruiting stations would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as popular as senators’ cellars, and the sentiment between
the two would have been much stronger than
the antagonism between the Bolshevists and the anti-saloon
league. But here we are presenting this valuable
dope several years too late. Tell your children
about it, and they can stop the next war though (if the
pretty girls aren’t all dead).</p>

<p>Then a bunch of senators, with big cellars and
stills in their attics, passed a law that the combination
of wine, women and song must be reduced to women
and song. Suppose we substitute nut-sundays, women
and song. Substitute your eye, we’ll just play the two
undeceased members of the combination a little
stronger, unless we get into some senator’s cellar.</p>

<p>Don’t cry, little children, the war is over, and so
is a lot of your money, but Uncle Sam will make a lot
more, and the Brigadier Generals and the movie actors
will get it.</p>

<p>At present we can assume that this is the Movie
Age and Out-rage. We walk right past a speech made
by the President or some other vote-made man, and
several miles to see “Doug” Fairbanks skin his shins
by walking up the side of a seven-story building on
his hands or to see Charlie Chaplin swing a broom at
the villain and hit the Queen of Russia, who is dressed
in sackcloth and ashes because of the murder of her
last thirty-three husbands.</p>

<p>Movie actors are all right, though. Why, they
make more money than we ever hear about. Figures
compiled by the Secretary of the Treasury show that a
man and wife and family of seventeen children and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
pets, could live on what Mary Pickford spends for silk
stockings, but that is the reason we go to the movies,
says the henpecked man as his wife drags him home to
their little boiler factory where rolling pins are used
as sledgehammers.</p>

<p>If prices keep increasing and clothes decreasing,
we will be restricted as to the number of leaves we can
wear, and they will be fastened to our shivering yet
magnanimous anatomy with paper fasteners of the
Henry Ford type. Shimmying will then be automatically
abandoned, while courting will only take place
over the telephone. When we think of Theda Bara it
will be as a heavily clad woman.</p>

<p>Just one thing further, and that is, if this world
keeps increasing its speed as it has in the past, our
heads will be going so fast that they will look like fish
bowls. Everything will just work backwards, our nose
will run and our feet smell. Just now we’re traveling
so fast that our hip pockets dip sand as we go around
corners, and our feet come up so often that people will
think we are laying down. Put on your brakes, dear
old United Statesers, and let’s slow down to 100 per,
or we’ll skid into Mexico.</p>

<p>It’s oft been said that woman is a mystery to us
that we will never quite see through, no matter how

to man, though now and then she condescends slightly
to lift the ban. It’s oft been said we cannot hope to
fathom womankind and to that fact the other sex might
well make up its mind. But we have called the libel
out and dragged it in the dirt. We see right through
her now with ease&mdash;thanks to the modern skirt.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><b>Reel One.</b> At last hearing “Doug” Fairbanks and
Mary Pickford were living here happily in their
little grey home in the west, on top of a big
Beverly hill. Every day or so appears a dispatch that
the Nevada authorities intend to dissolve the partnership
but this is taken to be the final, spasmodic throb
of a dying determination.</p>

<p>Doug thinks he’s married to Mary. Mary believes
she is married to Doug. Owen Moore, Mary’s former
hubby, is quite certain he isn’t married to Mary and
what the state of Nevada thinks isn’t causing any particular
excitement. If Nevada proved a convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
place to arrange the legal break and figures her dear
judges or lawmakers were slip-shoddy she should get
some new judges and lawmakers. What is done is
done.</p>

<p><b>Reel Two.</b> Recent presentation of the new Griffith
play, “Way Down East,” caused a laughable situation
for those who were aware of the facts. The laughable
situation did not get into the newspapers because some
of our very best families would have suffered humiliation.
It appears that “D. W.” issued several invitations
to prominent society women for the opening
night, as his “guests”&mdash;though he was in New York.</p>

<p>What a flurry and flutter there was among the
high-brows when they learned that the invites had gone
out. Who had been asked? It did not occur to the
high-brow ladies that D. W. Griffith is truly the master
mind of pictures and that his use of Mrs. Belmont in
the picture was smart bait to draw society. Mrs. Belmont
really didn’t have much to do but appear in an
up-to-date gown and give Lillian Gish a haughty look.</p>

<p>But society here went daffy when it became known
that some society women had been invited by Mr. Griffith’s
representatives, while others had not. Immediately
there was a buzz of phones and considerable
indignation, denouncements and heart-burnings seared
the wires. “How came it that Mrs. Such and So had
been invited and ‘I’ have not? It reflects upon my social
standing.”</p>

<p>How crafty old D. W. must have grinned as the
reports went into him of the society ladies’ wrath. For
lack of brains, poise and downright self-respect society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
women cart off the well known cake. Newspaper women
laughed themselves sick at the coy admissions discreetly
tendered them that “Oh, by the way, Mr. Griffith
sent me a personal invitation to be present at the
opening of ‘Way Down East.’” It possibly is stretching
it to say that the paper gals laughed themselves
sick. They have become so used to such situations that
they scarcely laugh at all. They just grin and “bear
it”&mdash;and proceed openly to kid society in the papers
without society apparently becoming the wiser.</p>

<p>It is almost pitiable to watch fair and heavy
matrons, who have done well, raising a family or starting
one, long for a chance to see themselves upon the
screen. They gaze upon Lillian Gish as some ravishly
blessed mortal lifted by the Gods but they see no reason
why they would not be just as good if given a
chance.</p>

<p>Much of the nasty gossip which follows prominent
picture folk emanates from the society morgues where
every skeleton known to scandal is laid carefully away
for future reference.</p>

<p>The fat ladies of wealth who are unable to fit into
the screen take a girl, perhaps like Lillian Gish, and
in seeming fury that the girl has succeeded, tear what
they may of her character to pieces. About any fashionable
hotel where gather the disappointed “widows”
and dames whose husbands have let them come west
for a “rest” may be heard the most intimate details
concerning the private life of every person prominent
on the screen. Nine times out of ten these details are
featured by everything but the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Every girl that ever worked for Griffith, whether
she knows it or not, has been the victim of whispers
relative to what price she paid for her success. Griffith
is a muchly misunderstood man. He is shrewd,
too smart for the average picture maker. His people
appear to reverence him. Probably no girl regrets her
experience and training under this particular director&mdash;though
not as much can be said for many other directors.</p>

<p>The name of Lillian Gish and Griffith have been
mentioned in unsavory tones more than once. The girl
is a remarkably fine young woman who scarcely would
know what was meant by the insinuations cast abroad
concerning her and the director. Wherever Lillian goes
her mother is not far away. The two sisters, Lillian
and Dorothy, are among the hardest workers upon the
screen. It is understood that the late Robert Harron
was extremely fond of Dorothy and it is understood
that this admiration was not returned in the way that
young Harron would have wished.</p>

<p>Harron had a number of sisters, who spent much
of their time about the studios where their brother
worked. The Gish and Harron families were constantly
together and a great friendship existed between them
all. It is understood that Dorothy admired Harron
tremendously but could not reciprocate his reported
love for her. Bobby Harron was an exceptional young
man from a moral standpoint. He was clean and wholesome.
In fact a number of the Griffith stars have been
marked for their personal virtues. In view of these
facts it is a relief to point out that some of the unmentionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
vices which beset Movieland are partially offset
by the cleanliness of many really great stars.</p>

<p><b>Reel Three.</b> One of the greatest “parties” yet
staged in Los Angeles, was given by a well known
director several nights ago. Now it should not be
assumed that the picture parties are particularly different
than some of the pajama and kimono parties
tendered in Hollywood and Pasadena. In fact many
of the picture ladies “hold out” longer than their more
discreet sisters who get their kick out of a monthly
party, whereas a picture girl has an invite a night and
knows every step and parry of the game.</p>

<p>One of the best known girls of the screen sat in
one chair throughout a recent party and visitors remarked
upon her serenity and refusal to rush the bar.</p>

<p>A wild woman from one of the comedies gave her
the once over. “Say, Edna’s been stewed for two
hours and can’t stand up. But she’s got sense enough
to keep still.”</p>

<p>But, referring to the big party. It lasted several
days. Some of the guests went home, changed their
clothes and came back again. The affair must have
cost thousands of dollars. The guests were not numerous
but well selected. A number of orchestras were
employed, one coming on as one went off shift.</p>

<p>The host was a man of parts. He employed chauffeurs
with cars ready to grab any guest who wished
to stumble home and might possibly not be deemed able
to guide his own car had he come without a driver.
Most of the drivers who came to the party left unceremoniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
when the party waxed late into the next
day. Even chauffeurs have feelings.</p>

<p>The newspaper accounts mostly were suave and
soft pedally. But it is said that some of the best newspaper
people remembered only the quietness of the
opening hour or so and were in no editorial mood to
recollect just everything that did happen.</p>

<p><b>Reel Four.</b> A great social mix-up occurred at
Hollywood the other morning. One of our best matinee
idols, a year or so ago separated from his wife and
half dozen children. He took unto himself another
wife. The decree allowed that the father could have
the children part of the time, or half of the time.</p>

<p>Following his new matrimonial venture the matinee
star found himself blessed one morning with a new
baby. Just recently the former wife emerged from the
east and took apartments at one of the most fashionable
Hollywood hotels. She was accompanied by a
flock of children.</p>

<p>The moment had come for the former husband to
have his time portion of the children. Bright and
early on the day after their arrival they made for the
father’s home, where they were happily received by
the foster mother who showed them their half sister,
her own child.</p>

<p>Kids will be kids, so it was no wonder that the
mother of the flock was surprised and amazed during
the course of the morning when one of her brightest
young hopes trundled a baby carriage into her room
and gaily announced that he had a new sister to show
her. He had come down from the home of his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and foster mother with sure enough evidence that
father still was raising children.</p>

<p>The papers stated that the mother was threatened
with hysteria and bade her surprised child take his
charge back to its father’s home. For comedy and
tragedy, go watch in the halls of childhood.</p>

<h3>Bull Frog Bull</h3>

<p>The Frog is a slick member of the reptile family
deriving its name from the Latin words E Hopus
Jumpus, meaning “Warts.” It has four legs, but only
finds use for two&mdash;the hind ones, which are built on
altogether different lines than the front ones, being
about five times as long, and fold under his body at a
very convenient angle, affording ample seating capacity.
The most common species of the Frog Family
are the Toad Frog and the Bull Frog. The French
people consider the Bull Frog quite a delicacy, and
all snakes are very fond of Toad Frogs. Some scientists
say the snake has far better taste than the Frenchman
when it comes to choosing its food. The Frog
can catch more flies than Tris Speaker, with far less
effort, and is about the only thing left in this grand
and glorious country with any hops in it.</p>

<h2><i>India’s September Morns</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>In this article, Reverend Morrill tells of the “royal
baths” of East India, where men and women recognize
no sex. In the February number of the WHIZ
BANG, the traveler-author will take our readers on a
brief expedition to South America, which, “Golightly”
assures us, is “the white slave market of the world.”
Night scenes in Rio de Janeiro, “the Gomorrah,” and
Buenos Aires, “the Sodom of South America,” will be
depicted as only Reverend Morrill can do.</i></p>

<p class="by">By REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center">Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Though the River of Time may wash away most
of my India memories, there is one thing that will
remain as long as I live&mdash;my royal bath at Delhi,
and the time, the place, and the girl.</p>

<p>Bathing has not only been a fad with me, but an
article of faith. At home I take a cold plunge every
morning, and on shipboard it is the thing I look forward
to with pleasure. A country is known by the
baths it gives, and in Constantinople, Moscow and
Budapest I learned that every little movement had a
meaning all its own. The bath, that like Moses’ rod
swallowed up all others, was the one at Delhi, where
cleanliness is not always next to godliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>India is a hot and sticky place for fleshy people,
and like Falstaff I was larding the lean earth as I
walked along. After hours of dusty driving and hard
sight-seeing I asked my guide if I could have a bath,
and he said, “Yes, Durbar bath.” I had missed the
royal pageant, but hoped to get the splash, so we drove
off the crowded street to a building which invited us
with shady walks and flowers. The native proprietor
ushered me into a darkened room and handed me a
napkin. I had been in India long enough to know what
to do with that square of linen, so I used it for a loincloth.</p>

<p>When I stepped into the bath I was “horrified” to
find a beautiful Mohammedan maiden standing there
before me with nothing on plus a bracelet. In agitation
I rang. The master came, and I told him I did
not want that woman there with the bath. He seemed
surprised, because she was part of it, shrugged his
shoulders, ordered her out, and beckoned to two stalwart
natives. They seized me, threw me down on the
marble, put a wooden pillow under my head, and then
splashed, massaged, pounded, twisted and kneaded
me, worked my arms like a windmill, rolled me like a
log, used me as a punching bag, went through a whole
course of gymnasium exercises on me, then grinned
and said, “Not finished.” I felt I was, when back
came the “sweet sixteen” smiling like Spring, and
with less covering than September Morn. I sprang up,
but she grabbed a towel and basin and laid me low,
then soused me and began to put on the finishing
touches. In broken English she tried to tell me all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
physical, mental and moral charms, which I admitted
because she was a woman, but I knew her Koran didn’t
square with my Old Testament, so thanking her, I fled,
like Joseph from Potiphar’s wife, to my room, where
my guide “Kim” came to the rescue, helped me to dress
and rushed me to the train or I might have been there
yet.</p>

<p>The letter “I” in India stands for indecency and
immorality in nearly everything I saw from Calcutta to
Bombay. Benares is washed by the Ganges, the worshippers
in the Ganges, and though every day is washday,
still the city and people are dirty. They need a
new Hercules to turn the Ganges through its Augean
stables filled with holy fakirs, anointed priests, pestiferous
pilgrims, obscene carvings and sacred bulls.</p>

<p>I entered the Cow Temple, stable of sitting and
standing bulls. The bull is a beatified beast. Priests
pet him, the godly natives garland his horns and kiss
his tail, virgin votaries bathe their hands, beautify
their faces and plaster their hair with the divine emanations
which Minnesota farmers use for fertilizer. At
weddings, for good luck, to keep evil spirits away, and
purify the place, a cow is backed up to the bride’s door
to decorate the threshold with fresh dung&mdash;bossy’s
contribution to the joyous occasion. The “Bull Durham”
of India is some of the same, dried and mixed,
with a little tobacco and paper. I have often imagined
that our yellow-fingered dudes imported it for cigaret
purposes&mdash;at any rate it smells like it. Like another
ill-fated Gulliver in the land of giants, I slipped around
in the filth till I got a kodak shot at his royal Bullship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Benares is called the “Holy City” on the principle,
I suppose, that “in religion, what damned error, but
some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a
text.” As well call ice hot, vinegar sweet, vice virtue
or hell heaven. One morning we pious pilgrims left
the ladies, who were not permitted to accompany us,
and climbed to the secluded spot where stands the Nepalese
temple ornamented with gymnastic and obscene
carvings that would make the red pictures of Pompeii
blush with shame. These filthy figures of men and
women, carved to please and pacify the gods, are not
mentioned in the guide-books or referred to above a
whisper in polite society. If this sex perversion marks
the high tide of Buddhist faith, I am ashamed, though
I have photos of the carvings which I keep in my
strong-box packed in chloride of lime. Kali Hinduism
may be bloody, but Buddhism here is beastly.</p>

<p>Almost as bad are the stone images and inscriptions
in the caves of Elephanta out from Bombay. The temple
columns, aisles and figures are hewn from the living
rock. I looked at the three-faced Siva, and noticed the
stylish headdress; saw another figure with cap ornament
of human skulls; Virag, half-male and female, and
the Siva shrine with the “lingam” altar before which
millions of barren wives and hopeless girls had prostrated
and prostituted themselves in Sivaite festivals.
The temple keeper beckoned me to one side and gave
me a private lecture on these “lingam,” phallus or
Priapus symbols of sex organ worship which I had
found in other lands. While he proceeded, my blush
illuminated the dark cave, and as I left the “altar” a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
lady of our party approached and asked me what I
had been looking at and what the guide said. I replied,
“Forget it!” She wouldn’t, I couldn’t, and since she
was past middle age and married, I looked her square
in the eye and reeled it off as if it were an Edison
record. “Thank you,” she said. “It is always well
to know about religion from a priest.” I told her I was
no priest and this was no religion. There was a pool
of clear water here and the frogs, big as turtles, were
standing on their hind legs, with folded arms and eyes
wide open with amazement, as if they were more shocked
at what I had said than at the suggestive statues and
symbols round about. If I had been alone I would
have divested myself of all baggage but my trunks
and plunged in to keep them company.</p>

<p>The blasé or bored can always find something new
at a Hindu wedding or Nautch dance. I saw Nautch
girls&mdash;dressed in scarlet skirts trimmed with gold,
caris or scarfs of brightest colors, trousers tight-fitting
and gilt-embroidered, bracelets or anklets of gold, and
silver bells&mdash;dancing for hours, illustrating pictures of
thought, passion and emotion, to love-throbs, tune and
time. Once I heard a story of the origin of the Nautch
dance: A Rajah’s daughter was stolen and raped; the
ravisher was caught by the father, strung up, slashed
like ribbons on a Maypole, then whirled around, and
anyone on whom the blood spattered was privileged
to assault any woman he met.</p>

<p>India has no old maids or bachelors. Cradles are
robbed of their babies for marriage, and some suitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
are promised before born if sexed right. The proverb
reads, “Every girl at 14 must be either a wife or a
widow.” Many men in India are slaves&mdash;all women
are. Woman is not to be trusted, and is held the cause
of man’s sin whether she be sage or fool. She is object
and subject as a child to her father, as wife to her husband,
and as widow to her son’s or husband’s relatives.
To obey her hubby is supposed to be the only
God she needs or wants. To obey and worship him
is to worship the gods (though he be a devil). Caste
injures them more than men, and she is old before 25
and looks it. Child-marriage is the style and prevails
in places, though the British government made a law
that a girl might be married yet not live with her husband
till she was 12 years old. Imagine a 10 year old
girl marrying a 30 year old man. Any negligent father,
who does not find a husband before his daughter is 12,
is held to be a public monster and criminal. Of course,
boys and girls mature earlier in the tropics and have
families when people North haven’t gone so far as to be
even sweethearts.</p>

<p>In the comparative study of other religions I could
always find some sweetness and light, but Hinduism
is darkness and dirt. Its votaries are vile, their gods
are deified beasts, and their devotees are beastly depraved.
Caste, child-marriage, obscene worship,
Nautch girls, ignorance, superstition, poverty and
plague prove Hinduism to be a hell on earth and a
disease that dwarfs and damns man’s body, mind and
soul.</p>

<h2>His Test of Faith</h2>

</div>

<p class="by">By RUDOLPH KUEFFNER</p>

<p class="dropcap">A couple, on their wedding trip, met a gypsy
whose prophecies so greatly amused them that
they gave her an extra dollar for good luck.
In appreciation of the gift, the grateful gypsy presented
her benefactors with a little white, glass phial
containing a clear liquid. She admonished them to
hold this phial as a sacred treasure, because the liquid
would retain its crystalline clearness only so long as
the loving couple were faithful to each other. But,
warned the gypsy, unfaithfulness on the part of either
will cause this liquid to turn a grayish hue.</p>

<p>The couple laughingly accepted the small bottle,
took it home and, although disbelieving the gypsical
dope-sheet, placed it carefully in an unused linen
closet. They soon forgot the incident and lived in
happiness for some time.</p>

<p>One summer, a few years later, the wife journeyed
afar to visit relatives. Letters of love were exchanged
and the hubby gave all his time to business cares, with
the exception of Sundays, when he would entertain a
few friends at his home. At one of these Sunday parties
he amused the guests with the gypsy story of
honeymoon days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>At the finish of the host’s recital, one of the men
with an eye to a practical joke suggested pouring a
bit of ink in the phial so as to make the liquid turn to
gray. “On her return you can have a lot of fun at
her jealousness,” he said, “and then call us in to
prove your faithfulness.” The trick was done and
in a few days Friend Wife came home.</p>

<p>While house-cleaning next day, she thought of
the phial. Great horrors! Its contents had turned
from pure white to a grayish tint. “My God, is it
really so?” But after a few moments of hesitation
she quickly poured out the gray substance and refilled
the phial with clear water, placing it back in its former
location.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it was not necessary for hubby’s
friends to call to testify in his behalf.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>The Difference</h3>

<p>The two school friends accidentally met in the
whirl of the city, and, of course, began a rapid fire of
questions.</p>

<p>“What am I doing?” said Gladys, in reply to a
query. “Oh, I’m a stenographer.” “What’s the boss
like?” “Well, he’s quite young, and is awfully kind
to me. See, he gave me this bangle and this brooch,
and nearly every week he takes me to dinner and the
theatre. And the salary’s quite good&mdash;$25 a week.
And you, Ethel&mdash;what are you doing, dear?”</p>

<p>“Same as you,” snapped Ethel, “only there’s no
shorthand-typing mixed up with it.”</p>

<h3>For Men Only</h3>

<p>Some of us poor, down-trodden he-men, and
farmers, chuckle with glee when our sturdy wives drag
us to church on Sunday to listen to such passages of
Scripture regarding the weaker (?) sex as follow. In
view of granting the ladies equal rights at the ballot,
these few lines appear to be particularly timely, so
follow closely, boys, and chuckle again:</p>

<div class="blockquote bold">

<p>“Let the woman learn in silence with all
subjection; suffer not woman to think or usurp
authority over man, for Adam was formed
first, not Eve.</p>

<p>“For a man indeed ought not to cover his
head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory
of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
For the man is not of the woman but woman
of the man. Neither was the man created for
the woman, but the woman for the man.
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands
as unto the Lord, for the husband is the
head of the wife even as Christ is the head of
the church.</p>

<p>“When thou goest forth to war against
thine enemies, and the Lord Thy God hast
delivered into thine hands, and thou hast
taken them captive, and hast seen among the
captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire
unto her that thou wouldst have her for thy
wife, then thou shalt bring her home to thy
house, and she shall shave her head, and pare
her nails.”</p>

water and was thanked for it. She was then asked to
get Mrs. Smith a drink. She complied and again was
thanked. She went through the same procedure for
four more ladies. After the last one had drank, the
mother proudly asked little Marjorie to bring in a drink
for her before going out to play.</p>

<p>In a few moments Marjorie returned, but without
water for mother.</p>

<p>“Muvver, I tant det any more water,” she childishly
lisped.</p>

<p>“Why not, my child, surely you’ll get your mother
a drink?”</p>

<p>“I tant, muvver, the water’s all don and I tant
weach the chain.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Did you ever feel embarrassed? We did, the other
day when the boss cow, Ethelbert, kicked over
our bucket at milking time and ripped our trousers
in front of the chickens. Write to us about your
embarrassed moments and let’s console each other.
For instance, Gus, our hired man, was in Minneapolis
the other day getting his usual supply of moonshine
and was riding on the street car to the depot.</p>

<p>“I noticed a girl sitting across the aisle that I had
met while in swimming at Lake Minnetonka last summer,”
said Gus when he got home, “I had not seen her
since until then. I tipped my cap and said ‘Hello!
How are you?’” and for a minute she looked at me
blankly and then burst out: “Oh, why, hello! I didn’t
recognize you with your clothes on.’ Of course this
attracted the attention of the passengers and I found
it more comfortable by getting off the car at the next
stop for another little drink.”</p>

<p>Now, of course, that may have been only Gus’s
alibi for coming home intoxicated.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>I had a similar experience myself last time I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in the city. A girl was telling me how embarrassed
she was. “Do you know,” she confided, “I was standing
in a doorway fixing my garter when a gust of wind
came along and blew the hair from off my right ear.
I was so embarrassed, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>Newspapers tell of a woman who, in order to
become a mother, obtained a divorce and married
another man for a year, after which she and her child
went back to her first husband. This is an exception.
Some women, it seems, now are inclined not to trouble
with the divorce proposition at all.</p>

<p>The trouble with the average man is that he seldom
increases his average.</p>

<p>Many a “good fellow” is so stingy with his family

<div class="verse">The pretty manicurist, Louise,</div>
<div class="verse">Has very many beaus;</div>
<div class="verse">She calls these fellows, if you please,</div>
<div class="verse">Her manicurios.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Holding hands is dangerous business. The hand
is the lightning conductor of love and lust. The
manicurist, like Othello, would find “occupation
gone” if hand-holding were practised by men or old
women. It is the sex element that usually attracts and
holds.</p>

<p>Many modest and decent manicurists go regularly
and professionally to the homes of their patients, or
are found in office, parlor or barber annex position.
Anywhere and everywhere they are pure and true
womanly.</p>

<p>People who won’t work with their hands are known
by the manicures they keep. Nails are peeled, pared,
polished and painted, while the owner’s rough mind
lives in the cellar and garret of mental and moral poverty.</p>

<p>Manicuring is a society luxury for men and women
who form the polished horde of bores and bored. The
world is still deceived with fuss and feathers and people
who hide grossness with fair ornament.</p>

<p>The manicure is a necessity for musicians, doctors&mdash;and
dudes and darlings in society who, beyond the
actual care of their body, in food, dress and drink,
think their hands were only made to wear gloves,
rings, be manicured, held or united in a “good catch”
marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The rich are manicured who have money to burn.
The idle are manicured who have time to waste. The
idiots are manicured who have no idea of the value of
time or money. Libertines are manicured who play
guilty Fausts to pure and innocent Margarets. Hotel
leechers and loafers are manicured who forget mother,
sister, wife or sweetheart.</p>

<p>They have no time or money for church or charity,
but sit by the hour holding a girl’s hand, looking into
her face, trying to fan a spark of passion into their
burnt-out cinder body while with hand, foot, eye and
tongue they try to make a date.</p>

<p>The word “hand” means to hold or seize and is
to man what the claw is to the bird, fin to fish, and hoof
to horse. The hand is marvelously made with 27 bones,
8 of which are in the wrist, 5 form the palms, and 14
the bones or phalanges, or fingers. The hand was
made for work, as proved by anatomy and Scripture&mdash;“Go
to work”; “Work earnestly with both hands”;
“Handsome is that handsome does”; and black or
white hands are fine which do good work. Angelo
carving marble, Raphael painting Madonnas, Shakespeare
writing immortal dramas, Beethoven copying
heavenly symphonies, Washington drawing his sword
for liberty, and Lincoln penning the Emancipation
Proclamation, spent little time or money in manicuring
parlors.</p>

<p>Beautiful are the hands of wife, sister, man or
friend which have directed, lead and lifted us by pitfall,
through marsh and despair to mount the height on
which we stand&mdash;hands perfumed with prayer, baptized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with tears, clasped with affection, and generous
with charity.</p>

<p>The man ought to be horsewhipped who uses the
words “hard,” “homely,” “unmanicured,” of the
hands of a father, calloused that they might give daily
bread; hands of a mother, blistered and aching for
work never done until they are crossed white in the
coffin and God gives them rest; baby hands which twine
around the trellis of our hearts and are unclasped by
Death.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Another “international marriage” has gone the
way of many spectacular predecessors&mdash;through the
divorce mill.</p>

<p>In this it is hardly noteworthy. Experience and
commonsense alike indicate that such unions rarely
can be successful. The base allurements of a British
title on one side and American gold on the other, are
not the sources in which wholesome happiness finds
its inspiration.</p>

<p>But in quite another way there is something worth
noting in the divorce proceedings through which Consuelo
Vanderbilt has freed herself, at last, from the
disreputable ninth duke of Marlborough. It is the
revelation, through her simple letters, of the true nobility
of birth which does not rest upon a “Burke’s Peerage”
or an “Almanach de Gotha.”</p>

<p>Miss Vanderbilt married this highly decorated
fortune hunter in 1895. Two children were born to
them. For their sakes the American wife, with womanly
reserve, suffered much indignity during many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
years. Eventually driven to a separation, she still
endured in silence, without resort to the unsavory publicity
of divorce, reflecting upon her growing sons.</p>

<p>These children came of age last winter. The wife
then made a last brave effort toward reconciliation.
There was a brief reunion&mdash;ending in a disgraceful
visit of the 45-year-old duke to Paris with a 25-year-old
female companion.</p>

<p>Blood will tell&mdash;the plain American kinds and
likewise the tainted blue sort that trickles through
“noble” veins.</p>

<p>Noah was building the ark. A gang of “drys”
hung around criticizing the job.</p>

<p>“Ever built an ark before?” asked the leader of
the gang.</p>

<p>“Nope,” replied Noah, pounding away.</p>

<p>“By what right do you assume that this boat
will be a success?” asked the other. “This has always
been a dry country and there has never been any need
for a so-called ark. What experience have you had
with your so-called ark upon which to base so absurd
a claim as that it will float? Don’t you know that
umbrellas and gaiters have gotten us through the thunderstorms
for the last forty years? There can be no
hope of success for your so-called ark.”</p>

<p>But Noah kept on building away. Then came the
Deluge, and for once in history, the knockers got what
was coming to them.</p>

<h3>’Ostler Joe</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I stood at eve when the sun went down, by a grave where a woman lies,</div>
<div class="verse">Who lured men’s souls to the shores of sin with the light of wanton eyes;</div>
<div class="verse">Who sang the song that the siren sang on the treacherous Lurley height,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose face was as fair as a summer’s day, and whose heart was as black as night.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Yet a blossom I fain would pluck today from the garden above her dust,</div>
<div class="verse">Not the languorous lily of soulless sin, nor the blood red rose of lust,</div>
<div class="verse">But a sweet white blossom of holy love that grew in that one green spot,</div>
<div class="verse">In the arid desert of Phryne’s life where all else was parched and hot.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In the summer, when the meadows were aglow with blue and red,</div>
<div class="verse">Joe, the ’ostler of “The Magpie,” and fair Annie Smith were wed;</div>
<div class="verse">Plump was Annie, plump and pretty, with a face as fair as snow,</div>
<div class="verse">He was anything but handsome was the “Magpie’s” ’ostler Joe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But he won the winsome lassie, they’d a cottage and a cow,</div>
<div class="verse">And her matronhood sat lightly on the village beauty’s brow;</div>
<div class="verse">Sped the months, and came a baby&mdash;such a blue-eyed baby boy!</div>
<div class="verse">Joe was working in the stables when they told him of his joy.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He was rubbing down the horses&mdash;gave them then and there,</div>
<div class="verse">All a special feed of clover, just in honor of his heir;</div>
<div class="verse">It had been his great ambition (and he told the horses so)</div>
<div class="verse">That the fates would send a baby who might bear the name of Joe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Little Joe, the child was christened and like babies grew apace,</div>
<div class="verse">He’d his mother’s eyes of azure, and his father’s honest face;</div>
<div class="verse">Swift the happy years went over, years of blue and cloudless sky,</div>
<div class="verse">Love was lord of that small cottage and the tempest passed them by.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Down the lane by Annie’s cottage chanced a gentleman to roam,</div>
<div class="verse">He caught a glimpse of Annie in her bright and happy home;</div>
<div class="verse">Thrice he came and saw her sitting by the window with her child.</div>
<div class="verse">And he nodded to the baby and the baby laughed and smiled.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So at last it grew to know him (Little Joe was nearly four),</div>
<div class="verse">He would call the pretty “gemplum” as he passed the open door;</div>
<div class="verse">And one day he ran and caught him and in child’s play pulled him in,</div>
<div class="verse">And the baby Joe had prayed for brought about the mother’s sin.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">’Twas the same old wretched story that for ages bards have sung,</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas a woman, weak and wanton, and a villain’s tempting tongue;</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas a picture deftly painted for silly creature’s eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the Babylonian wonders and the joy that in them lies.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Annie listened and was tempted&mdash;was tempted and she fell,</div>
<div class="verse">As the angels fell from heaven to the blackest depth of hell;</div>
<div class="verse">She was promised wealth and splendor and a life of gentle sloth,</div>
<div class="verse">Yellow gold for child and husband&mdash;and the woman left them both.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Home one eve came Joe, the ’ostler, with a cheery cry of “wife!”</div>
<div class="verse">Finding that which blurred forever all the story of his life;</div>
<div class="verse">She had left a silly letter, through the cruel scrawl he spelt,</div>
<div class="verse">Then he sought the lonely bedroom, joined his horny hands and</div>
<div class="verse">knelt.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Now, O Lord, forgive her, for she ain’t to blame,” he cried;</div>
<div class="verse">“For I ought to seen her trouble and a-gone away and died;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Why a girl like her&mdash;God bless her&mdash;’twasn’t likely as her’d rest</div>
<div class="verse">With her bonny head forever on a ’ostler’s ragged vest.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It was kind o’ her to bear with me, all the long and happy time,</div>
<div class="verse">So for my sake please to bless her, though you count her deed a crime;</div>
<div class="verse">If so be I don’t pray proper, Lord, forgive me, for you see</div>
<div class="verse">I can talk all right to ’osses, but I’m kinder o’ strange with Thee.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ne’er a line came to the cottage from the woman who had flown,</div>
<div class="verse">Joe, the baby, died that winter and the man was left alone;</div>
<div class="verse">Ne’er a bitter word he uttered, but in silence kissed the rod,</div>
<div class="verse">Saving what he told his horses, saving what he told his God.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Far away in mighty London rose the wanton into fame,</div>
<div class="verse">For her beauty won men’s homage and she prospered in her shame;</div>
<div class="verse">Quick from lord to lord she flitted, higher still each prize she won,</div>
<div class="verse">And her rivals paled beside her as the stars beside the sun.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Next she trod the stage half naked and she dragged a temple down</div>
<div class="verse">To the level of a market for the women of the town;</div>
<div class="verse">And the kisses she had given to poor ’ostler Joe for naught,</div>
<div class="verse">With their gold and priceless jewels rich and titled roues bought.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Went the years with flying footsteps while her star was at its height.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the darkness came on swiftly and the gloaming turned to night;</div>
<div class="verse">Shattered strength and faded beauty tore the laurels from her brow,</div>
<div class="verse">Of the thousands who had worshipped, never one came near her now.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Broken down in health and fortune men forgot her very name,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the news that she was dying woke the echoes of her fame;</div>
<div class="verse">And the papers in their gossip mentioned how an actress lay</div>
<div class="verse">Sick to death in humble lodgings, growing weaker every day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One there was who read the story in a far-off country place,</div>
<div class="verse">And that night the dying woman woke and looked upon his face;</div>
<div class="verse">Once again the strong arms clasped her that had clasped her long ago,</div>
<div class="verse">And the weary head lay pillowed upon the breast of ’ostler Joe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All the past he had forgiven&mdash;all the sorrow and the shame,</div>
<div class="verse">He had found her sick and lonely and his wife he now could claim;</div>
<div class="verse">Since the grand folks who had known her one and all had slunk away,</div>
<div class="verse">He could clasp his long-lost darling and no man could say him nay.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In his arms death found her lying, from his arms her spirit fled,</div>

<div class="verse">And the stone above her ashes bears the sacred name of wife.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">That’s the blossom I fain would pluck today from the garden above her dust,</div>

congenial couple, or to two business women. Bath, hot and cold

<h3>A Wet Wedding</h3>

<p class="sans">Weddings, like other things, are progressive affairs in Idaho.
Look at this from an Idaho paper:</p>

<p class="sans">“Yesterday at high noon Miss Helen ⸺ and Ward ⸺
were united in marriage at the home of the bride’s parents in Wardner.
The ceremony was performed in the spacious living room
which was beautifully decorated in syringes.”</p>

<h3>Har Du Got a Hod?</h3>

<p>An Irishman died and went to heaven. St. Peter
said, “I’m sorry, but we just got a big consignment of
Swedes from Minneapolis today and there is no more
room.” “Can I get in if I make room?” asked the
late arrival. “Certainly,” said St. Peter. The Irishman
shouted through the gate, “Hey, you fellows,
there’s free snuff in hell.” And he made room, all

<h3>In a Garden</h3>

<p>As I walked along the paths this morning picking
flowers, I found in the yellow heart of a Lady Slipper,
a little brown bee. My first impulse was to shake him
out of his honeyed abode, but as I looked at his velvety
body and the sunlit rainbow wings, a foolish tenderness
surged over me. Perhaps there were baby bees
at home that would starve if papa bee did not bring
back honey; and how useful this little creature was,
carrying the pollen from flower to flower&mdash;so I moved
on, leaving him unmolested. But even as I turned
away thinking these pure, sweet thoughts, the darn
thing stung me.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
